# Mongodb
MongoDB is a NoSQL database management system designed to store and manage large volumes of data in a flexible, document-oriented manner. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB uses a non-tabular format, making it ideal for applications that require scalability and high-performance data processing.
